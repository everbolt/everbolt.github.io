    <h1>CS 180: Project 4a - Image Warping and Mosaicing</h1>
    <p>Tobias Worledge, Fall 2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I created an image mosaic by using projective warping,
      resampling, and composition via human-labeled reference points on the
      individual image components. This allowed me to rectify a component of a
      single image, such as a section worksheet. It also allowed me to create a
      mosaic of multiple images, such as a panorama.
    </p>

    <h2>Image Rectification</h2>
    <p>
      I began by selecting the reference points in the image. I used the
      provided custom tool to select the corners of the worksheet in the
      picture. I knew that the worksheet was a piece of standard paper with
      dimensions 8.8inx11in. This allowed me to define the corresponding points
      for the warping to enforce those proportions.
    </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Shooting the Pictures</h2>
    <p>
      To create the image mosaics, I captured a series of photographs with
      significant overlap between each adjacent pair. I ensured that the images
      were taken from the same position, rotating the camera to capture
      different parts of the scene. This approach maintains a consistent center
      of projection, which is crucial for accurate homography estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just used my iPhone to take the pictures. After some testing, I realized
      that taking pictures of scenes that had consistent depths helped create
      good mosaics with fewer artifacts. Excluding people and other moving
      objects was also important
    </p>

    <h2>Recovering Homographies</h2>
    <p>
      The next step was to compute the homography matrices that relate each pair
      of images. I implemented a function
      <code>computeH(im1_pts, im2_pts)</code> that calculates the homography
      matrix <em>H</em> using a set of corresponding points between two images.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain accurate correspondences, I used the provided custom tool that
      allows me to select matching points in overlapping regions of the images.
      With more than four point correspondences, I set up an overdetermined
      linear system and solved for <em>H</em> using least-squares minimization.
      This method reduces the impact of noise and inaccuracies in point
      selection.

      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/skyline23_pts.png" />
        <p>Points for Skyline 2 and 3</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Warping the Images</h2>
    <p>
      With the homography matrices computed, I proceeded to warp the images to
      align them with a reference image. I implemented a function
      <code>warpImage(im, H)</code> that applies the homography to an image. I
      used inverse warping to map coordinates in the destination image back to
      the source image, ensuring that every pixel in the output image receives a
      value.
    </p>
    <p>
      To handle aliasing during resampling, I used bilinear interpolation. I
      also calculated the bounding box of the warped image by transforming the
      corner points of the original image, which allowed me to allocate the
      appropriate size for the output image.
    </p>
    <div class="image-row">
      <div style="width: 40%">
        <img src="./images/skyline12.png" />
        <p>Source Images</p>
      </div>
      <div style="width: 40%">
        <img src="./images/skyline23.png" />
        <p>Final Mosaic</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Combining into a 3-image Mosaic</h2>
    <p>
      After warping the images, I blended them together to create a seamless
      mosaic. I chose one image as the reference and warped the other images
      into its coordinate system. To avoid sharp transitions and edge artifacts,
      I used weighted averaging with an alpha mask for each image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alpha mask for each image was designed to have higher values at the
      center and gradually decrease towards the edges. This approach ensures a
      smooth blending in the overlapping regions.
