    <h1>CS 180: Project 4 - Image Warping and Mosaicing</h1>
    <p>Tobias Worledge, Fall 2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I created an image mosaic by using projective warping,
      resampling, and composition via human-labeled reference points on the
      individual image components. This allowed me to rectify a component of a
      single image, such as a section worksheet. It also allowed me to create a
      mosaic of multiple images, such as a panorama.
    </p>

    <h2>Image Rectification</h2>
    <p>
      I began by selecting the reference points in the image. I used the
      provided custom tool to select the corners of the worksheet in the
      picture. I knew that the worksheet was a piece of standard paper with
      dimensions 8.8inx11in. This allowed me to define the corresponding points
      for the warping to enforce those proportions.
    </p>

        <p>Resulting Worksheet</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Shooting the Pictures</h2>
    <p>
      To create the image mosaics, I captured a series of photographs with
      significant overlap between each adjacent pair. I ensured that the images
      were taken from the same position, rotating the camera to capture
      different parts of the scene. This approach maintains a consistent center
      of projection, which is crucial for accurate homography estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just used my iPhone to take the pictures. After some testing, I realized
      that taking pictures of scenes that had consistent depths helped create
      good mosaics with fewer artifacts. Excluding people and other moving
      objects was also important
    </p>

    <h2>Recovering Homographies</h2>
    <p>
      The next step was to compute the homography matrices that relate each pair
      of images. I implemented a function
      <code>computeH(im1_pts, im2_pts)</code> that calculates the homography
      matrix <em>H</em> using a set of corresponding points between two images.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain accurate correspondences, I used the provided custom tool that
      allows me to select matching points in overlapping regions of the images.
      With more than four point correspondences, I set up an overdetermined
      linear system and solved for <em>H</em> using least-squares minimization.
      This method reduces the impact of noise and inaccuracies in point
      selection.

        <p>Points for Skyline 2 and 3</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Warping the Images</h2>
    <p>
      With the homography matrices computed, I proceeded to warp the images to
      align them with a reference image. I implemented a function
      <code>warpImage(im, H)</code> that applies the homography to an image. I
      used inverse warping to map coordinates in the destination image back to
      the source image, ensuring that every pixel in the output image receives a
      value.
    </p>
    <p>
      To handle aliasing during resampling, I used bilinear interpolation. I
      also calculated the bounding box of the warped image by transforming the
      corner points of the original image, which allowed me to allocate the
      appropriate size for the output image.
    </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Combining into a 3-image Mosaic</h2>
    <p>
      After warping the images, I blended them together to create a seamless
      mosaic. I chose one image as the reference and warped the other images
      into its coordinate system. To avoid sharp transitions and edge artifacts,
      I used weighted averaging with an alpha mask for each image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alpha mask for each image was designed to have higher values at the
      center and gradually decrease towards the edges. This approach ensures a
      smooth blending in the overlapping regions.

    <h1>CS 180: Project 4b - Feature Matching!</h1>
    <p>
      In this part of the project, we focus on automatically detecting features
      in images and identifying shared features between two images. With these
      tools, we are able to automatically stitch images together without having
      to manually label correspondance points. This saves a bunch of effort and
      produces even more accurate results!
    </p>

    <h2>Detecting Corner Features</h2>
    <p>
      By modifying the provided Harris corners code, we are able to implement
      adaptive non-maximal suppression as described by the paper. This allows us
      to select a subset of the Harris corners that are well-distributed across
      the image and have a high corner response.
    </p>
    <h3>Here are the results for Skyline 1 and 2</h3>
    <div class="image-row">
      <div style="width: 40%">
        <img src="./images/anms_skyline_1.png" />
        <p>Skyline 1 ANMS</p>
      </div>
      <div style="width: 40%">
        <img src="./images/anms_skyline_2.png" />
        <p>Skyline 2 ANMS</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Feature Extraction</h2>
    <p>
      Ok, this is neat. We have a bunch of seemingly "important" points within
      each image, but how do we compare and associate these points across
      images? <br />
      <br />
      To do this, we extract so-called "features" at each of these points! These
      are 40-pixel patches centered at each corner point. We can think of these
      as fingerprints that are intended to uniquely describe the local image
      content around each corner point. While it would be great to use all of
      the pixels in the patch, this would be computationally expensive. Instead,
      we transform this window into an 8 by 8 pixel feature descriptor. We will
      use this descriptor to compare features across images.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Here are a few examples of the features extracted from Skyline 1 and 2
    </h3>
    <div class="image-row">
      <div style="width: 40%">

        <img src="./images/features_2.png" />
        <p>Skyline 2 Features</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Feature Matching</h2>
    <p>
      Ok neat! Now we have some unique features within each image. Let's figure
      out how to associate shared features across these two images! For each
      feature in the first image, we can compare it to all features in the
      second image and find the best match. This provides us with a set of
      corresponding features between the two images. We can take the strongest
      matches and use them to estimate the homography between the images.
    </p>
    <h3>Here are the strongest matches for Skyline 1 and 2</h3>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Using RANSAC</h2>
    <p>
      Ok, now we have a bunch of correspondance points, how can we use these to
      compute a homography, possibly more accurately than how we had done so
      before? RANSAC is a robust method for estimating the homography between
      two images given a set of correspondance points. In this implementation,
      we repeatedly select 4 random correspondance points that we found above
      and compute the homography between them. We then evaluate the homography
      on all correspondance points and keep track of the number of inliers. The
      homography with the most inliers is then selected as the best homography.
      <br />
      <br />By doing so, we are able to automatically find the best homography
      and stitch the images together using the code from the first part of the
      project.

    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <p>
      This is pretty neat! It took me ~15 minutes to pick out good
      correspondance points when manually stitching these images together. This
      implementation is able to automatically stitch the images together in a
      fraction of the time and with even more accuracy. It's worth noting that
      the results aren't drastically different, but with RANSAC, some of the
      warped images are slightly different. This probably means that the points
      that I picked manually were reasonably effective when stitching the images
      together.
    </p>
    <h3>RANSAC is pretty sick</h3>
    <p>
      I really enjoyed learning about how RANSAC works. I think many algorithms
      and techniques that we are taught aim to find the theoretical optimal
      solution for the problem at hand. In the real world, there are many
      problems that can't be solved optimally, and thus approximation algorithms
      become incredibly powerful. RANSAC is a great example of this. It's not
      guaranteed that RANSAC will find the best homography, but it provides some
      statistical certainty that the homography found will be reasonably good.
