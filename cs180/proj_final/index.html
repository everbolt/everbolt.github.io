    <h1>CS 180: Lightfield Camera</h1>
    <p>Tobias Worledge, Fall 2024</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I worked with a set of light field images. By shifting
      and averaging multiple viewpoints acquired on a plane perpendicular to the
      optical axis, I could control the plane of focus after capture. Changing
      the shift parameters (alpha) corresponds to refocusing at different depths
      in the scene. Additionally, by varying the number of cameras averaged, I
      simulated changing the aperture size: using more cameras approximates a
      larger aperture, resulting in shallower depth of field.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we can generate a bunch of these images, we can make a gif that
      slowly changes the focus of the given image! This shows the focus sweeping
      from one depth plane to another as alpha changes. Note how different parts
      of the scene come into sharp focus depending on the chosen alpha value.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem">
      <img
        src="./images/refocused/focus_sweep.gif"
        alt="Focus Sweep GIF"
        id="focusSweepGif"
      />
      <br />
      <button
        onclick="document.getElementById('focusSweepGif').src='./images/refocused/focus_sweep.gif'"
      >
        Replay
      </button>
    </div>

    <p>
      I generated a series of images by varying alpha. Each image is produced by
      shifting all the rectified images according to their camera positions and
      the chosen alpha, and then averaging. As alpha increases or decreases,
      different depth planes become sharp.
    </p>

    <h2>Simulating Different Apertures</h2>
    <p>
      By fixing a particular focus plane (choosing a single alpha that brings a
      certain region into best focus) and then varying how many cameras I
      average, I can simulate different aperture sizes. Fewer cameras correspond
      to a smaller synthetic aperture (and thus deeper depth-of-field), while
      using more cameras creates a larger aperture (and shallower
      depth-of-field).
    </p>

    <p>
      Below are some examples. All these images are focused at the same plane,
      but differ in how many camera viewpoints are averaged:

    <div class="image-row">

        <img
          src="./images/aperture/aperture_81.png"
          alt="81 Cameras Aperture"
        />
        <p>81 Cameras</p>

        />
        <p>121 Cameras</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img
          src="./images/aperture/aperture_289.png"

        />
        <p>289 Cameras (Large Aperture)</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      As the number of cameras (aperture size) increases, you can see the
      out-of-focus regions becoming blurrier, while the focused region remains
      sharp. This is analogous to using a lens with a larger physical aperture,
      which reduces the depth-of-field.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates the power of synthetic aperture imaging and
      post-capture refocusing using light field data. By computationally
      combining images from multiple viewpoints, we can simulate changing focus
      and aperture size after the images have been captured, achieving effects
      that would normally require specialized optics.
